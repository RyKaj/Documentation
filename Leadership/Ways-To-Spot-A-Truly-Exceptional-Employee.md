# Leadership : Ways To Spot A Truly Exceptional Employee


Personality traits form at an early age and are fixed by early
adulthood. Many important things about you change over the course of
your lifetime, but your personality isn’t one of them.

Personality is distinct from intellect (or IQ). The two don’t occur
together in any meaningful way. Personality is also distinct from
emotional intelligence (or EQ), and this is where the study, and most
leaders for that matter, have misinterpreted the term.

The qualities that leaders in the study called personality were
actually emotional intelligence skills. And unlike your personality,
which is set in stone, you can change and improve your EQ.

Exceptional employees don’t possess God-given personality traits; they
rely on simple, everyday EQ skills that anyone can incorporate into
their repertoire.

Leaders don’t need to go searching for these skills either (though it
doesn’t hurt when you find them); their duty is to help everyone on
their team harness these skills to become exceptional.

Just consider some of the EQ skills that leaders and managers commonly
mislabel as personality characteristics. These are the skills that set
exceptional employees apart.

**They’re willing to delay gratification.** One thing an exceptional
employee never says is, “That’s not in my job description.” Exceptional
employees work outside the boundaries of job descriptions. They’re
neither intimidated nor entitled; instead of expecting recognition or
compensation to come first, they forge ahead in their work, confident
that they’ll be rewarded later but unconcerned if they’re not.

**They can tolerate conflict.** While exceptional employees don’t seek
conflict, they don’t run away from it either. They’re able to maintain
their composure while presenting their positions calmly and logically.
They’re able to withstand personal attacks in pursuit of the greater
goal and never use that tactic themselves.

**They focus.** Student pilots are often told, “When things start going
wrong, don’t forget to fly the plane.” Plane crashes have resulted from
pilots concentrating so hard on identifying the problem that they flew
the plane into the ground. Eastern Airlines Flight 401 is just one
example: The flight crew was so concerned about the landing gear being
down that they didn’t realize they were losing altitude until it was too
late, despite alarms going off in the cockpit. Exceptional employees
understand the principle of “Just fly the plane.” They don’t get
distracted by cranky customers, interoffice squabbles, or switch to a
different brand of coffee. They can differentiate between real problems
and background noise; therefore, they stay focused on what matters.

**They’re judiciously courageous.** Exceptional employees are willing to
speak up when others are not, whether it’s to ask a difficult (or
“embarrassingly” simple) question or to challenge an executive
decision. However, that’s balanced with common sense and timing. They
think before they speak and wisely choose the best time and place to do
so.

**They’re in control of their egos.** Exceptional employees have egos.
While that’s part of what drives them, they never give their egos more
weight than what is deserved. They’re willing to admit when they’re
wrong and willing to do things someone else’s way, whether it’s because
the other way is better or it’s important to maintain team harmony.

**They’re never satisfied.** Exceptional employees have unparalleled
convictions that things can always be better—and they’re right. No one
is ever done growing, and there is no such thing as “good enough” when
it comes to personal improvement. No matter how well things are going,
exceptional employees are driven to improve, without forgetting to give
themselves a healthy pat on the back.

**They recognize when things are broken and fix them.** Whether it’s a
sticky desk drawer or an inefficient, wasteful process affecting the
cash flow of the entire department, exceptional employees don’t walk
past problems. “Oh, it’s been that way forever,” simply isn’t in their
vocabulary. They see problems as issues to be fixed immediately; it’s 
*that* simple.

**They’re accountable.** If you’re a manager trying to decipher a
bungled report, “It’s not my fault” is the most irritating phrase in the
English language. Exceptional employees are accountable. They own their
work, their decisions, and all of their results—good or bad. They bring
their mistakes to management’s attention rather than hoping no one will
find out. They understand that managers aren’t out to assign blame;
they’re out to get things done.

**They’re marketable.** “Marketable” can mean many things. Inside the
organization, it means “likeable.” Exceptional employees are well liked
by co-workers. They have integrity and leadership skills (even if
they’re not in an official leadership position) that people respond
to. Externally, it means they can be trusted to represent the brand
well. Managers know they can send these employees out to meet with
clients and prospects without worrying about what they’ll say or do.

**They neutralize toxic people.** Dealing with difficult people is
frustrating and exhausting for most. Exceptional employees control their
interactions with toxic people by keeping their feelings in check. When
they need to confront a toxic person, they approach the situation
rationally. They identify their own emotions and don’t allow anger or
frustration to fuel the chaos. They also consider the difficult person’s
standpoint and are able to find solutions and common ground. Even when
things completely derail, emotionally intelligent people are able to
take the toxic person with a grain of salt to avoid letting him or her
bring them down.

**Bringing It All Together**

Take notice of what’s not mentioned: coding skills, years of experience,
business degrees, etc. These things matter, but they won’t make you
exceptional.

as you do from me.*
